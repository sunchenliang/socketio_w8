socketio_w8
===========

Socketio client librairy for Windows 8.

Since the package [SocketIO4Net](http://socketio4net.codeplex.com/) is not supported for Windows Store App, we modified the source code to adapt the windows 8.
Something different: 
We didnâ€™t implement the reconnection because it will be treated in hAPI.
